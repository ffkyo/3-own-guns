To save the provided files and make the website work correctly, follow these steps:

Create a new folder: Make a new folder on your computer, for example, MyWebsite.

Save the HTML file:

Open a text editor (like Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on macOS, or VS Code, Sublime Text).
Copy the entire content of the TEST.html file.
Paste it into the empty text editor.
Save the file as index.html inside the MyWebsite folder. Make sure the file extension is .html.


Internet Connection: The website uses external resources (videos, images, and audio from catbox.moe, as well as the GSAP library from cdnjs.cloudflare.com). Make sure you have an active internet connection so these resources can be loaded.
Browser Compatibility: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) should display the website correctly.
Autoplay Policies: Some browsers have strict autoplay policies for media (especially audio). The start-screen is designed to capture user interaction before media playback to bypass these policies. If you experience issues with media playback, it's likely due to your browser blocking automatic playback until you click or tap on the screen.
